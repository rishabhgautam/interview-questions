# Coding Problems (ML-style) - Interview Notes

---

## 1. Intersection of Arrays

**Problem:** Given two arrays, return the intersection (common elements).  
**Idea:**  
- Use a `set` for one array and filter elements from the other: `set1 & set2` for unique intersection.  
- If duplicates matter, use a `Counter` on both arrays and take `min(count1[x], count2[x])` for each key.  
**Complexity:** O(n + m) time, O(n + m) space.

## 2. Find Duplicates in an Array

**Problem:** Given an array, return all elements that appear more than once.  
**Idea:**  
- Use a `set` or `Counter` to track frequencies; duplicates are elements where `count > 1`.  
- If array elements are in a constrained range, you can use an in-place marking trick (index-based).  
**Complexity:** O(n) time, O(n) space (or O(1) extra space for some in-place tricks).

## 3. Max Product of 3 Numbers

**Problem:** Given an integer array, find the maximum product of any three numbers.  
**Idea:**  
- Sort the array; candidates are:  
  - `product of three largest`  
  - `product of two smallest (possibly negative) and largest`  
- Answer = `max(l1*l2*l3, s1*s2*l3)`.  
**Complexity:** O(n log n) with sort, or O(n) with one pass tracking top3 and bottom2.

## 4. Combinations of k from n

**Problem:** Given `n` and `k`, return all combinations of `k` numbers chosen from 1..n.  
**Idea:**  
- Use **backtracking** / DFS: build combinations incrementally and stop when length = k.  
- At each position, choose to include or exclude next number, ensuring increasing order to avoid duplicates.  
**Complexity:** O(C(n, k) * k) time (to output all combinations), recursion depth up to k.

## 5. Euclidean Distance Between Two Series

**Problem:** Given two equal-length numeric series/vectors, compute Euclidean distance.  
**Formula:**  
- `dist = sqrt(sum((x_i - y_i)^2))`.  
**Implementation:**  
- In Python/NumPy: `np.linalg.norm(x - y)` or `math.sqrt(sum((a - b)**2 for a, b in zip(x, y)))`.  
**Complexity:** O(n) time, O(1) extra space.

## 6. Swap Two Numbers Without a Temporary Variable

**Problem:** Swap values of `a` and `b` without using an extra variable.  
**Methods:**  
- Arithmetic:  
  - `a = a + b; b = a - b; a = a - b` (beware overflow).  
- XOR trick:  
  - `a = a ^ b; b = a ^ b; a = a ^ b`.  
In high-level languages, the idiomatic and safest way is still tuple assignment: `a, b = b, a`.

## 7. XOR Filters & Bloom Filter Alternatives

**Bloom Filters:**  
- Probabilistic set membership structure with **false positives, no false negatives**.  
- Use multiple hash functions and a bit array; query checks all bits.

**XOR Filters:**  
- More space-efficient variant using XOR-based fingerprinting and specific construction over a small number of hash locations.  
- Lower memory and faster queries than Bloom filters in some settings; still probabilistic, usually very low false positive rate.

**Alternatives:**  
- **Cuckoo Filters:** Support deletions, use cuckoo hashing and fingerprints.  
- Choice depends on: need for deletions, memory budget, query speed, and acceptable false positive rate.
