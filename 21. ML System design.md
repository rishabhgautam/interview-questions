## 🧭 1. ML System Design Framework

| Step | Key Questions |
|------|---------------|
| Problem Framing | What business metric? Is ML needed? Latency? Scale? |
| Data Strategy | Where does data come from? Batch vs streaming? Ground truth? |
| Feature Pipeline | ETL, feature store, real-time vs offline features |
| Model Strategy | Type of model? Training paradigm? Offline vs online learning |
| Training Infra | GPUs? Distributed training? Experiment tracking? |
| Serving Strategy | Batch, real-time, edge? Containerization? |
| Evaluation | Offline metrics vs online (A/B, lift, ROI) |
| Monitoring & Maintenance | Drift, decay, logging, retraining triggers |

## ⚙️ 2. Key ML System Components

### 🏗️ Architecture Layers
```

Data Sources → ETL/Streaming → Feature Store → Model Training → Model Registry
↓                            ↑
Realtime Serving API ← Model Inference ← Monitoring & Feedback

```

### 🌐 Data Sources
- Logs, transactions, IoT, events, APIs, CRM, clickstream
- Batch (S3, BigQuery), Stream (Kafka, Kinesis)

## 📦 3. Feature Engineering & Feature Store

| Feature Type | Example |
|--------------|---------|
| Static | Age, gender, signup method |
| Dynamic | Last login, cart value, session time |
| Aggregated | 7-day average spend, click count |
| Real-time Features | Time since last transaction, session device |

🔹 Feature Store supports:
✓ Versioning ✓ Offline & Online store ✓ Reusability ✓ Consistency

## 🤖 4. Model Selection & Training Strategy

| Use Case | Typical Models |
|-----------|---------------|
| Fraud | Gradient Boosting, CatBoost, DNN |
| Recommendation | Matrix Factorization, Two-Tower, Transformers |
| Forecasting | ARIMA, Prophet, TCN, LSTM |
| NLP | BERT, GPT, T5, LLMs |

**Training Paradigms**  
- Offline batch training (classic ML)  
- Online learning (streaming, incremental)  
- Transfer learning, fine-tuning, LoRA, parameter-efficient training  

**Optimization Tools**: Optuna, Ray Tune, Weights&Biases, MLflow, KubeFlow

## 🚀 5. Model Serving Patterns

| Pattern | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| Batch Scoring | Weekly churn scoring, credit risk |
| Real-Time API | Chatbot, fraud detection, recommendations |
| Edge Inference | Drones, mobile apps, IoT devices |
| Hybrid (Feature Precompute + Realtime) | Ads, personalization |

🛠 Serving Infra: SageMaker, Vertex AI, Docker, TorchServe, Triton, FastAPI

## 🛰️ 6. Monitoring & Maintenance

| Type | What to Monitor |
|------|------------------|
| Data Drift | Feature distribution changes |
| Concept Drift | Target behavior changes |
| Latency & Cost | Model response, GPU $, API failures |
| Performance | Accuracy, AUC, business KPIs (lift, ROI) |

🛠 Tools: Evidently AI, Arize AI, Fiddler, Prometheus, Grafana

📌 Retraining Triggers:
- Periodic (monthly/weekly)
- Performance drop
- Drift alert
- New data availability

## ⚠️ 7. System Design Tradeoffs

| Tradeoff | Options |
|----------|---------|
| Latency | Light models vs complex (XGBoost vs BERT) |
| Accuracy | Deep learning vs Explainability |
| Cost vs Scale | GPUs vs CPU clusters |
| Freshness | Real-time vs precomputed |
| Security | Privacy, PII, consent |
