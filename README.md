## 🧩 What This Repo Is (and Isn’t)

**This repo _is_:**
- A set of **short, high-yield explanations** designed to be read and revised quickly.
- Focused on **conceptual questions** that come up repeatedly in ML / DL / LLM interviews.
- Written to help you **recall under pressure** (whiteboard / live coding / system design rounds).

**This repo is _not_:**
- A full textbook or exhaustive theory reference.
- A LeetCode clone with full problem implementations.
- A replacement for hands-on coding / building real projects.

Use it as your **companion notebook**, not the only source.
